# Business Sales Data Analysis

## Business Context
A retail company wants to understand sales trends, top products, and customer behavior to improve profitability.

## Objective
Analyze sales data to identify key trends, profitable products, and customer segments.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle “Superstore Sales”
- Columns: Order Date, Product, Region, Sales, Profit, Customer Segment

## Key Questions
1. Which products sell best?
2. Which regions generate the most revenue?
3. Which months/quarters are peak sales?
4. Which customer segments are most valuable?
5. Where are profit opportunities?

## Analysis & Insights

### Top Products by Sales

### Revenue by Region
![Sales by Region](images/sales_by_region.png)
> The West and East regions generate the highest revenue. The Central region shows lower sales → may need targeted campaigns.

### Peak Sales Months

### Customer Segments
> [Include plot or table: e.g., "Consumer segment makes the most frequent purchases."]

### Profit Opportunities

## Recommendations

- Upsell high-profit products in high-demand regions
- Target top customer segments with promotions

## Limitations
- Dataset only contains historical sales
- No external factors considered (e.g., seasonality, marketing campaigns)

## Next Steps
- Forecast future sales using time series analysis
- Expand analysis to include product pricing and promotions
